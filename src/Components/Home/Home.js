                        <p>I have a passion for learning and I'm in the Engineering Flex program 
                            through Thinkful. I fell in love with coding in high school and recently
                            decided to pursue a career in technology. I have  predominantly worked 
                            with HTML and CSS. During my undergraduate career I also took several 
                            semesters of computer science courses focusing on Java and Python. I am currently 
                            learning backend development with a focus on SQL and Node.js.
